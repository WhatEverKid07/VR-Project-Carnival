        <h1>VR Carnival Fiesta</h1>
        <p>A short 3-week group project making a carnival-themed VR game.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>We managed to make two carnival games, a duck shooter and hook-a-duck (we liked ducks), along with a carnival pier environment.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Art/Visuals:</span> We had a dedicated 2D and 3D artist to create the assets. Both artists were very pleased with the results, and so was I.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Sound/Music:</span> Due to our short time frame, we never properly discussed anything audio-related, so we don't have any music or sound effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Code:</span> Creating a VR game was relatively straightforward in most aspects, as many of the essential scripts were provided in a demo scene.
                I used the core scripts and objects required to make an object grabbable and adapted them to suit our game.
                Since most of our mechanics were simple, a short tutorial was enough for me to get started.
